# BetterHI3Launcher
A much better Honkai Impact 3rd launcher. Here's its key points:
* No need to install, everything's in one executable
* Doesn't have a weird dependency on 3rd party archivers in the system
* Can install both Global and SEA clients at the same time (with mirror support)
* Has useful features such as fixing subtitles, setting custom FPS, resetting game settings and even downloading cache files (useful for those folks that can't do it via the game)
* Automatically updates itself

I made this with hope to help people have a better experience with the game. I will actively support this project, but you are welcome to [open an issue](https://github.com/BuIlDaLiBlE/BetterHI3Launcher/issues) if something's wrong or improve upon my code via [pull requests](https://github.com/BuIlDaLiBlE/BetterHI3Launcher/compare).
