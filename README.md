# BetterHI3Launcher
A much better Honkai Impact 3rd launcher. Here's its key points:
* No need to install, everything's in one executable
* Doesn't have a weird dependency on 3rd party archivers in the system
* Can install both Global and SEA clients at the same time (with mirror support)
* Has useful features such as fixing subtitles, setting custom FPS, resetting game settings and even downloading cache files (useful for those folks that can't do it via the game)
* Automatically updates itself

System requirements: 64-bit version of Windows 10 (should run on 7 and 8.1 too if .NET Framework 4.6 or newer is installed).

I made this with hope to help people have a better experience with the game. I will actively support this project, but you are welcome to [open an issue](https://github.com/BuIlDaLiBlE/BetterHI3Launcher/issues) if something's wrong or improve upon my code via [pull requests](https://github.com/BuIlDaLiBlE/BetterHI3Launcher/compare).

## Contibuting translations
Want to contribute to the project by translating the launcher into a language you speak? Great! Here's how to do it:
1. [Download this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuIlDaLiBlE/BetterHI3Launcher/master/TextStrings_en.cs) (Ctrl+S after opening)
2. You will see a bunch of lines with text, on each line there are two strings: you don't need to touch the one on the left, only translate the one on the right
3. After you're done, [create an issue](https://github.com/BuIlDaLiBlE/BetterHI3Launcher/issues/new?assignees=BuIlDaLiBlE&labels=language+contibution&template=language_contribution.md&title=Language+contibution+%5BNAME+OF+THE+LANGUAGE+HERE%5D) with the name of the language and attach the file with translated strings to it

You're done! Please be ready to answer if there happens to be something that I need to clarify about your translation.

After I verify your submission and implement it you can be sure I will list your name in the "About" section of the launcher.

Translations may need updating in the future as I keep adding and changing things so I'd be eternally grateful if you keep a look at this project and update your submission with time.
