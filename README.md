# BetterHI3Launcher
A much better Honkai Impact 3rd launcher. Here are the key points:
* No need to install, everything's in one executable
* Supports all game clients (Global, SEA, CN, TW/HK/MO and KR), can switch between them freely
* Has mirror support so you have more download sources to choose from
* Automatically updates itself, so you're always getting the latest and greatest!
* Has lots of useful features, such as:
  * Downloading game cache (fixes the "stuck on updating settings" problem)
  * Fixing the notoriously broken subtitles
  * Repairing game files (only bad files will be downloaded!)
  * Moving the game
  * Setting custom resolution, custom FPS, resetting download type (to reselect assets download option)
  * Customizable background (supports still images, GIFs, and even videos!)

Works on 64-bit version of Windows 10 (7 and 8.1 should work too if .NET Framework 4.6.1 or newer is installed).

I made this with hope to help people have a better experience with the game.

## Contributing translations
Want to contribute to the project by translating the launcher into a language you speak? Great! Here's how to do it:
1. [Download this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuIlDaLiBlE/BetterHI3Launcher/dev/TextStrings_en.cs) (Ctrl+S to save)
2. You will see a bunch of lines with text, on each line there are two strings: you don't need to touch the one on the left, only translate the one on the right. Please do not touch special characters or backslashes such as `{0}`, `\n`, or `\"`.
3. After you're done, [create an issue](https://github.com/BuIlDaLiBlE/BetterHI3Launcher/issues/new?assignees=BuIlDaLiBlE&labels=language+contibution&template=language_contribution.md&title=Language+contibution+%5BNAME+OF+THE+LANGUAGE+HERE%5D) with the name of the language and attach the file with translated strings to it.

You're done! Please be ready to answer if there happens to be something that I need to clarify about your translation.

After I verify your submission and implement it you can be sure I will list your name in the "About" section of the launcher.

Translations may need updating in the future as I keep adding and changing things so I'd be eternally grateful if you keep a look at this project and update your submission with time.
